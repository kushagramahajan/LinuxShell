# LinuxShell

This is the code for a Linux shell that was made as part of the Operating Systems course. The shell is designed to perform all the basic shell
operations as well as complex functions like pipelining, redirecting input/output. System commands such as `top`, `kill`, `cp` etc. along with other popular linux commands are also compatible.
